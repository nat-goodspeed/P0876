\fiber is TLS-agnostic - best practice related to TLS applies to fibers too
(see P0772R0.)\\

A \fiber may not migrate between threads: it may only be resumed on the
\thread on which it was launched.

Certain \xtfiber instances may be migrated between threads, using special
methods as described below. However, if \anythread returns \cpp{false}, that
instance may not migrate between threads.

\cpp{cross\_thread\_fiber\_context::resume()}
and \cpp{cross\_thread\_fiber\_context::resume\_with()} may only be called on
the same \thread on which the fiber represented by that \xtfiber was last
running.

If \anythread
returns \cpp{true}, \cpp{cross\_thread\_fiber\_context::resume\_other\_thread()}
and \cpp{cross\_thread\_fiber\_context::resume\_other\_thread\_with()} may be
called on a different \thread than the one on which the fiber represented by
that \xtfiber was last running. \fiber does not have either of these methods.
