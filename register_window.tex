\abschnitt{fiber switch at architectures with register window}

The implementation of fiber switch is possible -- many libc implementations
still provide the ucontext-API (\cpp{swapcontext()} and related
functions)\footnote{ucontext was removed from POSIX standard by POSIX.1-2008}
for architectures using register window (like SPARC). The implementation of
\cpp{swapcontext()} could be used as blue-print for the fiber-API.
