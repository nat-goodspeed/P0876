\abschnitt{fiber switch on architectures with register window}

The implementation of fiber switch is possible -- many libc implementations
still provide the ucontext-API (\cpp{swapcontext()} and related
functions)\footnote{ucontext was removed from POSIX standard by POSIX.1-2008}
for architectures using a register window (such as SPARC). The implementation of
\cpp{swapcontext()} could be used as blueprint for a fiber implementation.
