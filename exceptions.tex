\abschnitt{exceptions}\label{exceptions}

In general, if an uncaught exception escapes from the \entryfn,
\cpp{std::terminate} is called. There is one exception: \foreignex. The \fiber
facility internally uses \foreignex to clean up the stack of a suspended context
being destroyed. Because this exception is an \foreignex it can not be catched.
