\abschnitt{exceptions}\label{exceptions}

In general, if an uncaught exception escapes from the \entryfn,
\cpp{std::terminate} is called. There is one exception: \unwindex. The \fiber
facility internally uses \unwindex to clean up the stack of a suspended context
being destroyed. This exception must be allowed to propagate out of an \entryfn.\\

A correct \entryfn\ \cpp{try/catch} block looks like this:
\cppf{rethrow_unwind}

Of course, no \cpp{try/catch} block is needed if neither \entryfn\xspace nor
anything it calls throws exceptions.
