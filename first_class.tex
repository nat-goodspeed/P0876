\abschnitt{fiber as a first-class object}

Because the symmetric control-transfer operation requires to explicitly pass
the control-transfer between fibers, fibers must be expressed as first class
objects.\\

Fibers exposed as \emph{first-class objects} can be passed to and returned from
functions, assigned to variables or stored into containers. With fibers as
first-class objects, a language can \bfs{explicitly control the flow of
execution} by suspending and resuming fibers, enabling control to pass into a
function at exactly the point where it previously suspended.\\

\zs{Symmetric control-transfer operation requires fibers to be first-class
object. First-class objects can be returned from functions, assigned to
variables or stored into containers.}
