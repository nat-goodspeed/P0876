\abschnitt{problem: avoiding non-const global variables and
undefined behaviour}\label{problem_gpub}

According to \emph{C++ core guidelines}\cite{coreguidlines}, non-const global
variables should be avoided because of hiding dependencies and making the
dependencies subject to unpredictable changes.\\
Global variables can be changed by assigning them indirectly using a pointer or
by a function call. As a consequence, the compiler can't cache the value of a
global variable in a register, degrading performance (unnecessary
loads and stores to global memory especially in performance critical loops).\\
Accessing a register is one to three orders of magnitude faster than accessing
memory (dependence to whether the cache line is in cache and not invalidated by
another core; and depending on whether the page is in the TLB).\\
The order of initialisation (and thus destruction) of static global
variables is not defined introducing additional problems for depended static
global variables.\\

\zs{A library designed to be used as building block by other higher-level
frameworks should prevent introducing global variables. If this API would be
specified in terms of internal global variables, no higher level layer can undo
that: it would be stuck with the global variables.}

\uabschnitt{switch back to \emph{main()} by return}
Switching back to \main by returning from the fiber function has two drawbacks:
it requires a internal global variable pointing to the suspended \main and
restricts the set of usages.
\cppf{return_to_main}
For instance the generator pattern is impossible because the only way
for a fiber to transfer execution control back to \main is to terminate. But
this means that no way exists to transfer data (sequence of values) back and
forth between a fiber an \main.\\

\zs{Switching to \main only by returning is impractical because it limits the
applicability of fibers and requires internal global variable pointing to
\main.}

\uabschnitt{static member function returns active fiber}
P0099R0\cite{P0099R0} has introduced a static member function\\
(\cpp{execution_context::current()}) that returned an instance of the active
fiber. This allows to pass the fiber \cpp{m} (represents \main) into the fiber
\cpp{l} via lambda capture. This mechanism enables to switch back and forth
between fiber and \main enabling a rich set of applications (for instance
generators).
\cppf{static_current}

But this solution requires a internal global variable pointing to the active
fiber and some kind of reference counting. Reference counting is needed because
\cpp{fiber::current()} allows to construct multiple instance of the active
fiber. If one instance goes out of scope the other instances must be still
valid. But the last reference must destruct the fiber and deallocate the stack.
\cppf{multi_current}

Additionally a static member function returning a instance of the active fiber
would violate the protection requirements of sections \nameref{stackmgmt} and
\nameref{invalidation}. For instance the active fiber could accidentally be
resumed by invoking \resume.
\cppf{resume_current}

\zs{A static member function returning the active fiber requires a reference
counted global variable and does not prevent for accidentally resuming the
active fiber.}
