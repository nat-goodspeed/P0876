\abschnitt{\fiber as building block for higher-level frameworks}

A low-level API enables a rich set of higher-level frameworks that provide
specific syntaxes/semantics suitable for specific domains. As an example, the
following four frameworks are based on the low-level fiber switching API of
\bcontext\cite{bcontext} (implements the API of this proposal).

\uabschnitt{\bcoroutine}\cite{bcoroutine2} implements \bfs{asymmetric coroutines}
\cpp{coroutine<>::push_type} and \cpp{coroutine<>::pull_type}, providing a
unidirectional transfer of data. These stackful coroutines are only used in
pairs. When \cpp{coroutine<>::push_type} is explicitly
instantiated, \cpp{coroutine<>::pull_type} is synthesized and passed as
parameter into the coroutine function. In the
example below, \cpp{coroutine<>::push_type} (variable \cpp{writer}) provides the
resume operation, while \cpp{coroutine<>::pull_type} (variable \cpp{in})
represents the suspend operation. Inside the lambda,\cpp{in.get()}
pulls strings provided by \cpp{coroutine<>::push_type}'s output iterator support.

\uabschnitt{\synca}\cite{synca} (by Grigory Demchenko) is a small, efficient
library to perform asynchronous operations in synchronous manner. The main
features are a \bfs{GO-like} syntax, support for transferring execution context
explicitly between different thread pools or schedulers (portals/teleports) and
asynchronous network support.
\cppf{synca_ex}

The code itself looks like synchronous invocations while internally it uses
asynchronous scheduling.

\uabschnitt{\bfiber}\cite{bfiber} implements \bfs{user-land threads} and combines
fibers with schedulers (scheduler-algorithms are customization points). The API
is modelled after the \thread-API and contains objects like
\cpp{future}, \cpp{mutex},\\
\cpp{condition_variable} ...
\cppf{bfiber_ex}

\uabschnitt{Facebook's \fbfibers}\cite{fbfiber} is an asynchronous C++ framework
using \bfs{user-land threads} for parallelism. In contrast to \bfiber,
\fbfibers\xspace exposes the scheduler and permits integration with various
event dispatching libraries.
\cppf{fbfiber_ex}

\fbfibers\xspace is used in many critical applications at Facebook for instance
in \fbmcrouter\cite{fbmcrouter} and some other Facebook services/libraries like
ServiceRouter (routing framework for \fbthrift\cite{fbthrift}), Node API (graph
ORM API for graph databases) ...\\

\zs{As shown in this section a low-level API can act as building block for a
rich set of high-level frameworks designed for specific application domains
that require different aspects of design, semantics and syntax.}
