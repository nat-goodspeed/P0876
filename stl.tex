\abschnitt{interaction with STL algorithms}

In the following example STL algorithm \cpp{std::generator} and fiber \cpp{g}
generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and store them into \cpp{std::vector}
\cpp{v}.
\cppf{generator}

\zs{The proposed fiber API does not require modifications of the STL and can be
used together with  STL algorithms.}
