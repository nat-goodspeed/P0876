\abschnitt{abstract}

At the November 2017 meeting in Albuquerque the members of the committee
concluded that stackful context switching is important and decided to pursue the
technology.\\

This paper addresses concerns, questions and suggestions from the past meetings.
The proposed API reflects the former proposals N3985\cite{N3985},
P0099R1\cite{P0099R1} and P0534R3\cite{P0534R3}.\\
Because of name clashes with \emph{coroutine} from coroutine TS,
\emph{execution context} from executor proposals and \emph{continuation} used
in the context of \cpp{future::then()}, \emph{fiber}, as suggested by some
committee members, has been chosen - \emph{filament}, \emph{tasklet},
\emph{lightfiber} or \emph{coop\_task} are alternative names.\\

The minimal API enables stackful context switching \bfs{without} the need for a
\bfs{scheduler}. The API is suitable to act as building-block for high-level
constructs such as stackful coroutines as well as cooperative multitasking
(aka user-land/green threads that incorporate a \bfs{scheduling facility}).\\

A fiber is represented by the first-class object \fiber.
