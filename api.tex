\rSec2[fiber-context]{Cooperative User-Mode Threads}

\rSec3[fiber-context.general]{General}

The extensions proposed here support creation and activation of cooperative
user-mode threads, here called \emph{fibers}.

A fiber is a thread of execution ([intro.multithread.general]) with
weakly parallel forward progress guarantees ([intro.progress] paragraph 11).

The term ``user-mode'' means that control can be passed from one fiber to
another without entering the operating-system kernel.

The term ``cooperative'' means that typically multiple fibers share an
underlying execution agent, for example a \cpp{std::thread}. On the
underlying execution agent, only one fiber is running at any given time. Sharing
that agent is explicit rather than pre-emptive. The running
fiber \emph{suspends} (or \emph{yields}) to another fiber. This
action \emph{launches} a new fiber, or \emph{resumes} a previously-suspended
fiber.

Suspending the running fiber in order to resume (or launch) another is
called \emph{context switching}. This is an explicit variant of blocking with
forward progress guarantee delegation ([intro.progress] paragraph 14).

Launching a fiber logically creates a new function call stack, which remains
associated with that fiber throughout its lifetime. Calling functions on a
particular fiber, and returning from them, is independent of function calls
and returns on any other fiber.

Context switching can be effected by designating some other fiber's stack as
current, in a manner appropriate to the existing implementation of function call stacks.

\rSec3[fiber-context.empty]{Empty vs. Non-Empty}

A \fiber instance may be \emph{empty} or \emph{non-empty}. A
default-constructed \fiber is empty. A moved-from \fiber is empty. A \fiber
representing a suspended fiber is non-empty.

\rSec3[fiber-context.implicit]{Explicit Fiber vs. Implicit Fiber}

The default thread on which the program runs \main has an
initial \emph{default fiber} whose stack is the stack on which \main is
entered. \tsnote{Thus, when \main instantiates a new \fiber, it becomes the
second fiber in the program.} Similarly, every explicitly-launched
\cpp{std::thread} or \cpp{std::jthread} has an initial default fiber whose
stack is the stack on which the function passed to \cpp{std::thread} or
\cpp{std::jthread}'s constructor is entered.

We use the phrase \emph{explicit fiber} or \emph{explicitly-launched fiber} to
designate a fiber instantiated by user code; conversely, \emph{implicit fiber}
designates the default fiber on any thread. An implicit fiber's \emph{owning
thread} is the thread of which that fiber is the default fiber. An explicit
fiber has no owning thread. Instead, when necessary, we speak of the thread on
which a fiber was first resumed.

A fiber is explicitly instantiated by passing an \emph{\entryfn} to \fiber's
constructor. This function is not entered until the first call to one of
the \cpp{fiber\_context::resume()} family of methods.

When a fiber is first entered, a synthesized non-empty \fiber instance
representing the newly-suspended previous fiber is passed as a parameter to
its \entryfn. Once entered, a fiber may suspend by calling one of the \resume
family of methods on any available non-empty \fiber instance. When the
suspended fiber is resumed, that method returns a synthesized \fiber instance
representing the newly-suspended previous fiber.

The synthesized \fiber instance received in either of those ways might
represent either an explicit fiber or an implicit fiber.

An explicit fiber terminates by returning from its \entryfn. If the \entryfn
returns a non-empty \fiber instance, the fiber represented by that \fiber
instance is resumed.

%% \rSec3[fiber-context.toplevel]{Implicit Top-Level Function}

%% On every explicit fiber, the behaviour is equivalent to calling the \entryfn
%% passed to \fiber's constructor from an implicit top-level function.
%% If the fiber is later
%% unwound, this conceptual top-level stack frame serves as delimiter: this point
%% is where unwinding stops.

If the fiber's \entryfn exits via an exception, \cpp{std::terminate} is called.

%% Returning a \fiber instance from the explicit fiber's \entryfn is equivalent
%% to returning control to the implicit top-level function.
%% Similarly,
%% when \unwindfib unwinds a fiber stack, it conceptually returns the \fiber
%% instance it was passed to the implicit top-level function. Either way, the
%% The
%% conceptual implicit top-level function is responsible for deallocating the
%% explicit fiber's stack memory on return from the \entryfn.
%% 
%% Similarly, on every implicit fiber, the behaviour is equivalent to passing control through an
%% implicit top-level function above \main and above the \entryfn for
%% each \thread.
%% The conceptual stack frame for this implicit top-level function delimits
%% stack unwinding for each of these stacks. If the fiber stack is unwound,
%% control is conceptually returned to this implicit top-level function.
%% The conceptual top-level
%% function for an implicit fiber does not deallocate the fiber's stack memory,
%% since the host environment will do that.

%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item
%%     \item If an empty \fiber instance is returned to the conceptual top-level
%%     function for an explicit fiber, the calling thread is terminated.
%%     \item If an empty \fiber instance is returned to the conceptual top-level
%%     function for the default fiber of an explicit thread, that thread is
%%     terminated.
%%     \item If an empty \fiber instance is returned to the conceptual top-level
%%     function above \main, the process is terminated.
%% \end{itemize}
