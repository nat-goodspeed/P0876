This wording is relative to N4964.\cite{Standard}

\bfs{Append} to ยง6.9.2.1 \stdclause{intro.multithread.general} as indicated:

\setcounter{section}{6}

\setcounter{subsubsection}{2}
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{4}

3 A \emph{processor thread} is the default thread of execution on
which \main is entered, or the thread of execution created by \thread
(\stdclause{thread.thread.class}), or the thread of execution created
by \jthread (\stdclause{thread.jthread.class}).

4 A \emph{fiber} is a thread of execution with weakly parallel forward
progress guarantees (\stdclause{intro.progress} paragraph 11).

5 A \emph{function call stack} represents the invocation sequence
(\stdclause{stacktrace.general} paragraph 2) of every evaluation in the thread
of execution.

6 Each fiber has a one-to-one association with a function call stack.
Calling functions on a particular fiber, and returning from them, is
independent of function calls and returns on any other fiber.

7 The default thread of execution on which \main is entered has an
initial \emph{default fiber} whose function call stack is the stack on
which \main is entered. \tsnote{Thus, when \main creates a new fiber, it
becomes the second fiber in the program.}
Similarly, every explicitly-created \thread or \jthread has an initial default
fiber whose function call stack is the stack on which the function passed to
the respective constructor is entered.

8 A new fiber may be explicitly created (\stdclause{fibercontext}).
\emph{explicit fiber} or \emph{explicitly-launched fiber} designates a fiber
created by program evaluation; conversely, \emph{implicit fiber} designates
the default fiber on any processor thread.

9 On entry, a processor thread blocks with forward progress guarantee
delegation (\stdclause{intro.progress} paragraph 14) on its default fiber. The
running fiber may block with forward progress guarantee delegation on another
fiber.

\bfs{Modify} ยง6.9.2.2 \stdclause{intro.races} paragraph 2 as indicated:

Two expression evaluations \emph{conflict} if \add{ they are running on distinct
threads of execution with forward progress guarantees}\\
\add{stronger than weakly parallel, and} one of them modifies a memory location
(\stdclause{intro.memory}) and the other one reads or modifies the same memory
location. \add{\enternote If either thread of execution has weakly parallel forward
progress guarantees,}\\
\add{it does not conflict with the other. \exitnote}

\bfs{Append} to ยง14.4.8 \stdclause{except.handle} as indicated:

\add{It is implementation-defined whether the currently handled exception
designates the exception with the most recently}\\
\add{activated handler that is still active within:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \add{the current thread of execution, or}
    \item \add{the current \thread.}
\end{itemize}

\bfs{Append} to ยง14.6.3.1 \stdclause{except.uncaught} as indicated:

\add{It is implementation-defined whether \cpp{uncaught\_exceptions()} returns
the number of uncaught exceptions in:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \add{the current thread of execution, or}
    \item \add{the current \thread.}
\end{itemize}

\bfs{Insert} new final subclause in clause 33 \stdclause{thread} as indicated:

\rSec2[fibercontext]{Cooperative Threads}

\rSec3[fibercontext.general]{General}

\para A fiber is a thread of execution (\stdclause{intro.multithread.general}) with
weakly parallel forward progress guarantees (\stdclause{intro.progress} paragraph 11).

\para The term \emph{cooperative} means that typically multiple fibers share a
given processor thread. On the underlying processor thread, only one fiber is
running at any given time. Sharing that processor thread is explicit rather
than pre-emptive. The running fiber \emph{suspends}, or \emph{yields} to
another fiber. This action enters a newly created fiber, or \emph{resumes} a
previously-suspended fiber.

\para Suspending the running fiber in order to resume (or enter) another is
called \emph{context switching}. This is an explicit case of blocking with
forward progress guarantee delegation (\stdclause{intro.progress} paragraph 14).

\rSec3[fibercontext.empty]{Empty vs. Non-Empty}

\para A \fiber instance is either \emph{empty} or \emph{non-empty}. A
default-constructed \fiber is empty. A moved-from \fiber is empty. A \fiber
representing a suspended fiber is non-empty.

\para When the running fiber returns a \fiber from its \entryfn, thus resuming the
designated fiber, the synthesized \fiber passed into the resumed fiber is
empty.

\para An explicit fiber is instantiated by passing an \emph{\entryfn} to \fiber's
constructor. This function is not entered until the first call to one of
the \cpp{fiber\_context::resume()} family of methods.

\begin{itemize}
    \item An implicit fiber's \emph{owning thread} is the thread of which that
          fiber is the default fiber.
    \item An explicit fiber initially has no owning thread.
    \item When some thread first calls \anyresume on an explicit fiber, that
          thread becomes the fiber's owning thread.
\end{itemize}

\para When a fiber is first entered, a synthesized non-empty \fiber instance
representing the newly-suspended previous fiber is passed as a parameter to
its \entryfn. Once entered, a fiber may suspend by calling one of the \resume
family of methods on any available non-empty \fiber instance. When the
suspended fiber is resumed, that method returns a synthesized \fiber instance
representing the newly-suspended previous fiber.

\para The synthesized \fiber instance received in either of those ways might
represent either an explicit fiber or an implicit fiber.

\para An explicit fiber terminates by returning from its \entryfn. If the \entryfn
returns a non-empty \fiber instance, \thefiber{that \fiber instance} is resumed.

%% \rSec3[fibercontext.toplevel]{Implicit Top-Level Function}

%% On every explicit fiber, the behaviour is equivalent to calling the \entryfn
%% passed to \fiber's constructor from an implicit top-level function.
%% If the fiber is later
%% unwound, this conceptual top-level stack frame serves as delimiter: this point
%% is where unwinding stops.

\para If the fiber's \entryfn exits via an exception, \cpp{std::terminate} is called.

%% Returning a \fiber instance from the explicit fiber's \entryfn is equivalent
%% to returning control to the implicit top-level function.
%% Similarly,
%% when \unwindfib unwinds a fiber stack, it conceptually returns the \fiber
%% instance it was passed to the implicit top-level function. Either way, the
%% The
%% conceptual implicit top-level function is responsible for deallocating the
%% explicit fiber's stack memory on return from the \entryfn.
%% 
%% Similarly, on every implicit fiber, the behaviour is equivalent to passing control through an
%% implicit top-level function above \main and above the \entryfn for
%% each \thread.
%% The conceptual stack frame for this implicit top-level function delimits
%% stack unwinding for each of these stacks. If the fiber stack is unwound,
%% control is conceptually returned to this implicit top-level function.
%% The conceptual top-level
%% function for an implicit fiber does not deallocate the fiber's stack memory,
%% since the host environment will do that.

%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item
%%     \item If an empty \fiber instance is returned to the conceptual top-level
%%     function for an explicit fiber, the calling thread is terminated.
%%     \item If an empty \fiber instance is returned to the conceptual top-level
%%     function for the default fiber of an explicit thread, that thread is
%%     terminated.
%%     \item If an empty \fiber instance is returned to the conceptual top-level
%%     function above \main, the process is terminated.
