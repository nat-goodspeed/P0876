\abschnitt{solution: avoiding non-const global variables and
undefined behaviour}\label{solution_gpub}

\zs{The \emph{avoid con-const global variables} guideline has an important
impact on the design of the fiber API!}

\uabschnitt{synthesizing the suspended fiber}\label{synthesizing}
The problem of global variables or the need for static member functions
returning the active fiber can be avoided by \bfs{synthesizing} the
\bfs{suspended fiber} and passing it into the resumed fiber (as parameter if the
fiber is started the first time or via in-place assignment of the instance that
has suspended the fiber previously by invoking \resume).
\cppfl{synthesized_foo}

In the pseudo-code above the fiber \cpp{f} is started by invoking its member
function \resume at line 6. This operation suspends \cpp{foo}, invalidates
instance \cpp{f} and synthesizes a new fiber \cpp{m} that is passed as parameter
to the lambda of \cpp{f} (line 2).\\
Line 3 calls \cpp{m.resume()} that suspends the lambda, invalidates \cpp{m} and
synthesizes a fiber that get \bfs{in-place assigned} to \cpp{f}. The control
flow is transferred from line 3 to line 6. After returning from \cpp{f.resume()}
at line 6, instance \cpp{f} represents the suspended fiber executing the lambda
(that is suspended at line 3).\\
Call \cpp{f.resume()} at line 7 invalidates \cpp{f} and suspends \cpp{foo()}
again. A fiber, representing the suspended \cpp{foo()} is synthesized and
in-place assigned to \cpp{m} at line 3. The execution control is transferred to
line 3 returning from \cpp{m.resume()}. Instance \cpp{m} represents the
suspended \cpp{foo()}.\\
Function \cpp{foo()} is resumed at line 4 by executing \cpp{m.resume()} so that
execution control returns in line 6 and so on ...\\

Class \cpp{symmetric_coroutine<>::yield_type} from  N3985\cite{N3985} is
\bfs{not} equivalent to the synthesized fiber.\\
\cpp{symmetric_coroutine<>::yield_type} does not represent the suspended context,
instead it is a special representation of the same coroutine. Thus \main or
thread's \entryfn\xspace can \bfs{not} be represented by \cpp{yield_type}
(see next section \nameref{representation}).\\
Because \cpp{symmetric_coroutine<>::yield_type()} yields back to the starting
point, e.g. invocation of\\
\cpp{symmetric_coroutine<>::call_type::operator()()},
both instances (\cpp{call_type} as well ass \cpp{yield_type}) must be preserved
(otherwise UB occurs at resumption).\\


\zs{This API is specified in terms of passing the suspended fiber, a higher
level layer can hide that by using global variables.}

\uabschnitt{distributing \emph{main()} and thread's \entryfn\xspace as fiber}\label{representation}
As shown in the previous section a synthesized fiber is created and passed as
instance of \fiber into the resumed fiber.\\
\cppfl{synthesized_main}

This is a nice feature because it allows \main and thread's \entryfn\xspace to
be represented as a fiber. A fiber representing \main or thread's
\entryfn\xspace can be handled like explicitly created fibers, it passed to
and returned from functions or stored in containers.\\
In the code snippet above the suspended \main is represented by instance
\cpp{m} and can be stored in containers, scheduled together with \cpp{f}
according to a scheduling algorithm.

\zs{The proposed fiber API allows to represent and handle \main and thread's
\entryfn\xspace by a instance of \fiber in the same way as explicitly created fibers.}

\uabschnitt{fiber returns (terminates)} When a fiber returns (terminates), what
should happen next? Which fiber should resumed next? The only way to avoid
internal global variables that point to \main is to explicitly return a fiber
instance that will be resumed after the active fiber terminates.
\cppfl{terminating_fiber}

In line 5 the fiber is started by invoking \resume on instance \cpp{f}. \main
is suspended and a instance of type \cpp{fiber} is synthesized and passed as
parameter \cpp{m} to the lambda at line 2. The fiber terminates by returning
\cpp{m}. The control is transferred to \main (return from \cpp{f.resume()} at
line 5 while the fiber \cpp{f} is destructed.

\zs{\fiber as return value from a function used to construct a fiber avoids
global variables -- the function passed to fiber's constructor must be of
signature `\cpp{fiber(fiber&&)}`.}
